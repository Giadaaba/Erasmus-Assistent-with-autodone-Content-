# Erasmus-Assistent-with-autodone-Content-

## Objective 
This project aims in developing an integrated platform using Autodone and a dedicated Mastodon account to support Erasmus students at the Philosophische Fakultät of Uni zu Köln. This platform will help students navigate administrative tasks, course registration, exam deadlines, and housing options in Cologne, providing timely reminders, resources, and peer support.

## Target Audience 
The target audience is Erasmus and international students at the University of Cologne, primarily those unfamiliar with the German academic and housing systems.

## Problem Statement 
The goal of the project is helping students to navigate the academic administration, course and exam registration, and securing housing in a new country can be challenging for incoming Erasmus students. The absence of centralized resources often leads to confusion and missed deadlines. This project will create an automated system for notifications and a supportive social media space to make these processes smoother.

## Main features 
- Autodone Integration for Administrative Support. 
- Mastodon Social Media Account for Real-Time Support and Community Building.

## Technological Tools 
- Mastodon Account
- Autodone
- Excel Calendar Integration
- Canva 
- Google Forms

## Expected Outcomes 
- A comprehensive, automated notification system that helps Erasmus students stay on top of academic and housing deadlines.
- Improved student experience by minimizing the stress of navigating the University of Cologne’s administrative processes.
- A supportive online community on Mastodon where students can find information, ask questions, and interact with peers.

## Procedure 
- We have pre-selected areas to gather relevant material to facilitate navigation at the University of Cologne for Erasmus students. Six main areas have been chosen on which the posts will be based: 1. Housing in Cologne, 2. Administrative tasks, 3. Course registration, 4. Exam deadlines, 5. Work and project experiences, 6. Events. We decided to divide these six topics between us, with each of us responsible for three areas.
- We wrote the Universität zu Köln about our project and ask if we can create an official Mastodon page for International Students. 
- We created a shared Excel file with five columns (date, time, text, picture, picture description) where we document the details of each post within the different areas. We gather information from the official University of Cologne website, emails we receive, and other official websites that we identify as authentic sources.

## Peoblems
1. The issue arose because the “Enter” key for inserting a new line in Excel was not functioning, causing problems in Autodone, which failed to process the blank spaces correctly, resulting in an absence of readable content.
2. Long content: Autodone has a word limit for the content you can create, ensuring concise and focused communication.
3. Official Page: We contacted the University of Cologne to create an official page for the PhiFak faculty but haven’t received a response. The University’s official Mastodon page follows us, and presenting our project to them could help make the profile official in the future.
